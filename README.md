etl challenge is done by using spring boot MVC, Thymleaf, and H2 Database. We can upload the two (or any number of CSV file) by using the user interface provided and the CSV files will be inserted in to one Customer database.

ws challenge is done by using spring boot RESTfull API, actuator for monitoring, Swagger for documentation and H2 database. I followed the best practices as much as possible.

JS challenge is done by using Angular 8 with Angular Material, I directly uploaded the JSON file from the assets folder, change it to Customer class then provide a search functionality by different parameters such as ID, First Name, Last Name, or Email.

UI/UX challenge is done by using Angular 8 with Angular Material as a front end, and Spring boot Restfull API as a backend. It provides functionality to create, read, update and delete customers. It also have search functions by different parameters. And we can load all customers in DB if required.

For all functionalities I provided a screenshot of the application working in my local linux machine.
